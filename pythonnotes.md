# Python Notes

## dict vs {}
Its better use literals instead of dict() constructure as it would be faster, simple and clean to read the code

## input() vs raw_input()
Python 3 we need to use input. Python 2 it considers input() as an type expression where it considers raw_input() as string. We need to carefully use those.
